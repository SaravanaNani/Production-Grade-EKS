# 📝 Case Study: End-to-End EKS Cluster with Monitoring and Security

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **production-grade Kubernetes (EKS)** setup integrating:
- Secure TLS ingress via cert-manager
- Application deployment with persistent storage
- Full observability using Prometheus + Loki + Grafana
- Namespace protection using Kyverno

---

## ⚙️ Stack Components

| Category | Tools |
|-----------|-------|
| Infrastructure | AWS EKS, Bastion, gp3 Storage |
| Security | cert-manager, Let’s Encrypt, Kyverno |
| Monitoring | Prometheus Operator, Loki, Grafana, Promtail |
| Storage | AWS EBS CSI Driver (gp3) |
| CI/CD | Jenkins integration (optional) |

---

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| 1 | EKS + Bastion provisioning |
| 2 | TLS and cert-manager setup |
| 3 | Monitoring stack integration |
| 4 | EBS CSI driver + storage validation |
| 5 | Security policies + dashboards |

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- ✅ Secure HTTPS via Let’s Encrypt  
- ✅ Real-time observability (metrics + logs)  
- ✅ Automated EBS volume provisioning  
- ✅ Namespace-level governance  

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- IRSA is critical for secure AWS integrations.  
- Loki is far lighter than ELK for logs.  
- Dashboards unify metrics and logs seamlessly.  
- gp3 storage delivers better throughput with cost savings.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Integrate Alertmanager for proactive alerts.  
- Add multi-tenant Grafana dashboards.  
- Deploy Loki in high-availability mode.
